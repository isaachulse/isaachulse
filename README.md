Visit my homepage, [isaac.hulse.wtf](https://isaac.hulse.wtf), it's the closest thing I have to social media right now. 
There's some odds and ends in my repos, but the funky github pages stuff is below:
- [i probably use this utility more than anyone else to get a null char onto my clipboard](https://isaac.hulse.wtf/null)
- [just incase you'd like to see how much the CO2 ppm has increased since you were born](https://climate.hulse.wtf)
- [don't even try to figure out how this website works (i promise the spacebar helps)](https://isaac.hulse.wtf/bpm-tap)
- [might you be sitting the java oca anytime soon?](https://isaac.hulse.wtf/oca_notes/)
